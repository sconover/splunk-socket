- max_count (or, auto_finalize_ec?) is less than the result count. call done
 - consider sending reasons for done (max_count hit)
- server should be resilient. trap and print errors
- terminate/delete the splunk search job on client disconnect
  ...in all cases...delete the job on finished too?
  ...resilient...what if the job is gone already?
- default job max_time alongside max_count
 - when the job finished because of timeout, send that down in done description
- allow other splunk api search params to be passed through
 - just convert from json to url params

...IOW, establish time and 'bandwidth' box
  point to the REST api docs on search POST in the readme...

splunk search
	  ??? search.onTimeout(function() {})
	  search.onError(function() {})
      search timeout? does the splunk api support this?
      
extract "extend"
  use options?

jshint

get jasmine out of vendor. claim the node js name and do a proper npm dependency

dependency into https://github.com/azuisleet/libxmljs
